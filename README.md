# About the AppImage format

An AppImage bundles built software into a single executable file, making its use as simple as downloading and running. This particular AppImage does
not fulfill the entire intent of the format (some dependencies need to be installed on the host), but it allows for PrusaSlicer to be more easily 
used, removed and upgraded by an end user.
