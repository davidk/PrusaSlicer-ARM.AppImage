# Setup:
# * Configure a github token with the appropriate permissions to your repository.
# * Name it GITHUB_TOKEN and place it in ~/.config/github-token.
# * Change the variables below, like REPO_URL and target_commitish

# Running:
# * Allow container-build.sh to finish.
# * Run this utilitiy with ./stage-release.sh ../aarch64-build.log
